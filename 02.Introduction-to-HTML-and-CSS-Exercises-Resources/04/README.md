## Requirements:

 - Create an HTML document named **list-of-posts.html**.
 - Ensure the document includes the basic HTML structure (doctype, html, head, body).
 
**2. CSS File Setup:**
 - Create a CSS file named **list-of-posts.css**.
 - Link the **list-of-posts.css** file to your **list-of-posts.html** document using the **link** tag in the **head** section.

**3. Blog Posts Structure:**
 - Use an **article** element for each blog post to semantically represent the content.
 - Within each **article**, include a **header** element that contains the post title (**h2**), post time (**time**), and author (**span** or **p**).
 - Follow the header with a paragraph (**p**) serving as the post excerpt or summary.
